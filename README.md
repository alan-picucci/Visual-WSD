# Visual-WSD

This repository contains the work done by Elettra Favazza, Fabio Pernisi, Lorenzo Tarricone and I in creating a solution to [Task 1 of the 17th international workshop about Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2023)](https://raganato.github.io/vwsd/), which consists in the following: given a potentially ambiguous word in a limited textual context, we aim to develop a deep learning model capable of selecting the most suitable image, from a set of 10 candidate images, that corresponds to the intended meaning of the target word.

The code is available in the Jupyter notebook, while the report summarizing the methods and results is in pdf format.
